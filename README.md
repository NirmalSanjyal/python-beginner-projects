# 🐍 Python Beginner Projects by Nirmal Sanjyal

Welcome to my collection of beginner-friendly Python projects. These were created as part of my 100-day learning journey to master Python, software development, and data science.

Each project here helped me improve core concepts like:
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Input validation (`try/except`)
- Data handling (strings, numbers)
- User interaction via CLI
